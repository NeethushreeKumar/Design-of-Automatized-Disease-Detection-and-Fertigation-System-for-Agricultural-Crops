# Design-of-Automatized-Disease-Detection-and-Fertigation-System-for-Agricultural-Crops
An AI and IoT-based system for automated crop disease detection and fertigation. It uses image analysis to detect diseases early, optimizing water and nutrient delivery for sustainable farming, enhancing crop yield, and reducing resource waste.

# Design of Automatized Disease Detection and Fertigation System for Agricultural Crops

## Project Overview
This project aims to support the agricultural sector by developing an automated disease detection and fertigation system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). This system leverages machine learning techniques to identify crop diseases through image analysis and administer precise fertilizer and water delivery (fertigation) based on crop needs. By minimizing fertilizer overuse and preventing crop disease, this project seeks to promote sustainable farming, improve yield, and optimize resource usage.

## Features
- **Disease Detection**: Identifies crop diseases based on leaf images using AI.
- **Automated Fertigation**: Delivers nutrients and water based on crop requirements to optimize health and yield.
- **IoT Integration**: Uses sensors for real-time environmental data, such as temperature, soil moisture, and humidity, which influence fertigation.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Integrates with a mobile application (Blynk) for farmers to monitor and control the system remotely.
- **Sustainable Agriculture**: Reduces excessive fertilizer use, lowers costs, and minimizes soil pollution.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing AI models and data processing.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building and training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and analysis.
- **IoT Components**: Sensors like DHT22 (temperature/humidity), YL-69 (soil moisture), solenoid valves, and ESP32 Cam for image capture.
- **Blynk**: For mobile-based IoT control and monitoring.
- **NodeMCU & Arduino**: Microcontrollers for managing sensors and actuators.
